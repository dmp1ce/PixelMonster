Design Overview

The basic idea to the game is a clone of snake except that eating different things gives different powers.  Also there will be some monsters running around shooting stuff at you.
- If you are hit in the tail then the bottom half of the tail will fall away and stay as a wall.
- Pixels will start to appear randomly, so they can be collected.
- Enemies will randomly spawn and move across the map.  More and more will appear over time.

How do you die?
- when an enemy hits you in the pixel monsters face with a bullet or you run into a wall.
