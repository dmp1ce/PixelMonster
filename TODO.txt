1. Create a game loop                                         [x]
2. Draw a pixel -> this is your pixel monster                 [x]
3. Have keys to move pixel around                             [x]


4. Draw some pixels around the screen.  Maybe as text somewhere     
5. When the pixel you control gets close to the pixels then they become part of your pixel monster
