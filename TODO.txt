Create a game loop                                         [x]
Draw a pixel -> this is your pixel monster                 [x]
Have keys to move pixel around                             [x]

Make the "pixel" slightly bigger
Make it so that random pixels are on the board
When the head pixel runs over another pixel it starts to follow behind
