1. Create a game loop
2. Draw a pixel -> this is your pixel monster
3. Have keys to move pixel around
4. Draw some pixels around the screen.  Maybe as text somewhere
5. When the pixel you control gets close to the pixels then they become part of your pixel monster


How do you die?
- You die when you last pixel has been erased

Easors and erasor vortex monsters?
- Will try to erase your pixels

Other pixel monsters will try to take your pixels.
- If another pixel monster shots you then it will knock loose pixel you have collected
- If you are down to a few pixed and you are hit by a pixel monster projectile, then you are also defeated and lose.

You kill vortex monsters by shooting high speed pixels at them, which will bring them down to size, or split them up.

Pixels will start to appear randomly, so they can be collected.  Possibly, text pixels could also be used.
